		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This class represents a basic control model which is typically known from DCC tools like Blender. [name] is used
			in the official [link:https://threejs.org/editor/ three.js editor].

			It is a simplified version of [page:OrbitControls].
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Camera object], [param:HTMLDOMElement domElement] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:Camera object]: The camera to be controlled.
			</p>
			<p>
				[page:HTMLDOMElement domElement]: (optional) The HTML element used for event listeners. By default this is the whole document,
				however if you only want the controls to work over a specific element (e.g. the canvas) you can specify that here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Creates a new instance of [name].
			</p>
		</p>

		<h2>Events</h2>

		<h3>change</h3>
		<p>
			Fires when the camera has been transformed by the controls.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 center]</h3>
		<p>
			The focus or target point of the controls.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:HTMLDOMElement domElement]</h3>
		<p>
			The HTMLDOMElement used to listen for mouse / touch events. This must be passed in the constructor; changing it here will
			not set up new event listeners. Default is the whole document.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean enabled]</h3>
		<p>
			Whether or not the controls are enabled.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Camera object]</h3>
		<p>
			The camera to be controlled.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number panSpeed]</h3>
		<p>
			The panning speed. Default is *0.002*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number rotationSpeed]</h3>
		<p>
			The rotation speed. Default is *0.005*.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Number zoom]</h3>
		<p>
			The zoom speed. Default is *0.1*.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:null focus] ( [param:Object3D Object3D] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:Object3D Object3D]: The 3D object that should be focused on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Focuses the center point of the given 3d object.
			</p>
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null pan] ( [param:Vector3 delta] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:Vector3 delta]: The amount of panning that should be applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Performs panning according to the given delta value and the respective panning speed.
			</p>
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null rotate] ( [param:Vector3 delta] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:Vector3 delta]: The amount of orbiting that should be applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Performs orbiting according to the given delta value and the respective rotation speed.
				When orbiting, the camera always looks at the [page:.center center] vector.
			</p>
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null zoom] ( [param:Vector3 delta] )</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
				[page:Vector3 delta]: The amount of zooming that should be applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Performs zooming (in fact dollying) according to the given delta value and the respective zoom speed.
			</p>
		</p>

		<h3>[method:null dispose] ()</h3>
		<p>
			Should be called if the controls is no longer required.
		</p>
